## Installation

It's recommended to use an isolated Python environment, for example using `venv`. To create and activate a virtual environment in the project directory, run from the terminaln:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then, the project dependencies can be installed and/or updated by simply running:

```bash
pip install .
```
